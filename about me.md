Hi, I'm Dante. I am a technical artist studying in the undergrad program at the University of Utah in the games program. I took an early interest in videogames and game development, going as far to spend more time with a ton of random game engines i found online rather than playing actual games early on. Back in high school, i participated in a community college dual enrollment program where i got to learn digital media and videogame development, making between two and four games (depending on how many i am able to recover, long story) over the course of two years. 

i also pretty quickly took to the 3d program Blender (i think around 8th or 9th grade) where i would spend a lot of time making random art pieces that came to my head. while i made steady progression with modeling for a while, but was quickly consumed by materials and shaders. i still don't fully understand what it is that hooked me, but this very technical and procedural part of digital art is still what interests me most to this day. and while i have mostly switched from blender in favor of game specific programs like Unreal and Mixer, i still have enough knowledge to assist friends who are years ahead of me in the program.

give me a clear task and a healthy dose of clear documentation, and i can handle a decent chunk of problems thrown my way.
